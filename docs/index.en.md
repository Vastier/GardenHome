Yo!

My name is Iago:Viana, A.K.A. Vastier.

Here's my Digital Garden / CopperMind / Repository of Knowledge /
Public Learning place. I'll talk more about those names in the future.

I have several hobbies, some of them are 3D Printing, Music, Electronics,
WebDev, Crochet, Origami, RPG, [Writing](textindex.md), Programming,
Creating guides (mostly personal use), Talking about The Vast
and some other stuff that sometime i'll add here.

I'm Brazilian and Brazilian Portuguese is my native language, some pages may
only exist in Portuguese, but i'll try to keep it mostly bilingual. (for now.)

In case you want to [know more about this web page.](about_this_page.md)
